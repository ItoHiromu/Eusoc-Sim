# Eusoc-Sim
Set of programs for evolution simulation of eusociality drived by genomic imprinting.
This simulation demonstrates the life cycle  of colony of ancestor termite.

## Main files

Main.java: Main file of the simulation.

Queen.java: 
Child.java: 
Termites.java:

## System requirements
### Required software
* OS Windows 10 
* The main codes of the simulations were implemented in Java, Java version "12.0.1" and Java (TM) SE Runtime Environment 12
* For running of simulations, JDK(Java SE Development Kit) is needs to be installed (https://www.oracle.com/jp/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
* For compiling, path setting is needed (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html).

### Versions the software has been tested on
* OS: Windows 10 Pro Ver.1903
* CPU: Intel Core i9-7900X CPU 3.30GHz

### Installation guide
* Instructions: Download

## Demo
### Instructions to run the simulation
* To compile, enter the command below at the command prompt, 
  '''bash
  $ javac Main.java
  '''
  then we get 5 class files i.e.,  Main.class, Main$RESULTS_LIST.class, Child.class, Queen.class amd Termites.class.
* To run the simulation, enter the command below at the command prompt,
  '''bash
  $ Java Main
  '''
  then we get 8 csv files i.e.,
